# END-TO-END-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: RAKSHITHA M

INTERN ID: CT04DH142

DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

THIS PROJECT IS A COMPLETE CAT VS DOG IMAGE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM BUILT USING PYTHON, PYTORCH, TORCHVISION, AND FLASK. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TRAIN A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL TO CLASSIFY IMAGES AS CAT OR DOG, SAVE THE TRAINED MODEL, AND DEPLOY IT USING A FLASK WEB APPLICATION FOR REAL-TIME PREDICTIONS.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE PYTHON SCRIPTS, EACH RESPONSIBLE FOR A SPECIFIC TASK.
MODEL.PY DEFINES A CUSTOM CNN ARCHITECTURE.
TRAIN_MODEL.PY HANDLES MODEL TRAINING USING THE DATASET STORED IN THE DATASET/TRAIN DIRECTORY.
MAIN.PY COMBINES DATA LOADING, TRAINING, EVALUATION, AND TEST IMAGE PREDICTION.
APP.PY DEPLOYS THE TRAINED MODEL AS A WEB APPLICATION, ALLOWING USERS TO UPLOAD AN IMAGE AND GET A PREDICTION IN REAL TIME.

WORKFLOW OF THE PROJECT
1️ MODEL DEFINITION
THE CNN ARCHITECTURE (CUSTOMCNN) HAS:
TWO CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS WITH RELU ACTIVATION AND MAXPOOLING.
ONE FULLY CONNECTED HIDDEN LAYER AND AN OUTPUT LAYER WITH TWO NEURONS (FOR CAT AND DOG CLASSES).
2️ DATA LOADING AND PREPROCESSING
THE DATASET IS ORGANIZED IN A FOLDER STRUCTURE COMPATIBLE WITH TORCHVISION.DATASETS.IMAGEFOLDER. IMAGES ARE RESIZED TO 128×128 PIXELS AND CONVERTED INTO TENSORS USING TRANSFORMS.
3️ TRAINING THE MODEL
LOSS FUNCTION: CROSSENTROPYLOSS
OPTIMIZER: ADAM WITH LEARNING RATE 0.001
TRAINING IS RUN FOR 5 EPOCHS, DISPLAYING LOSS AND ACCURACY AFTER EACH EPOCH.
THE FINAL TRAINED MODEL IS SAVED AS CAT_DOG_MODEL.PTH.
4️ EVALUATION AND PREDICTIONS
AFTER TRAINING, THE MODEL IS TESTED ON THE TRAINING DATASET TO CALCULATE ACCURACY. ADDITIONALLY, SAMPLE TEST IMAGES ARE LOADED FROM A TEST_IMAGES FOLDER, AND PREDICTIONS ARE DISPLAYED USING MATPLOTLIB.
5️ FLASK WEB DEPLOYMENT
THE APP.PY FILE USES FLASK TO CREATE A SIMPLE WEB INTERFACE WHERE USERS CAN UPLOAD AN IMAGE. THE IMAGE IS PREPROCESSED AND PASSED TO THE TRAINED MODEL TO PREDICT WHETHER IT IS A CAT OR A DOG, AND THE RESULT IS DISPLAYED ON THE WEBPAGE ALONG WITH THE IMAGE.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED
PYTHON – PRIMARY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
PYTORCH – FOR BUILDING, TRAINING, AND SAVING THE CNN MODEL.
TORCHVISION – FOR IMAGE DATASETS AND TRANSFORMATIONS.
PIL (PILLOW) – FOR IMAGE HANDLING.
MATPLOTLIB – FOR VISUALIZING TEST IMAGE PREDICTIONS.
FLASK – FOR CREATING THE WEB APPLICATION.
OS – FOR HANDLING FILE PATHS AND DATASET MANAGEMENT.

 APPLICATIONS OF THIS PROJECT
 PET IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM – USED IN PET APPS OR ADOPTION WEBSITES TO DETERMINE IF AN UPLOADED IMAGE IS A CAT OR DOG.
 EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES – DEMONSTRATES A COMPLETE MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE FROM DATA LOADING TO DEPLOYMENT.
 DEPLOYMENT DEMO – CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH WEB OR MOBILE APPS TO SHOWCASE AI MODEL DEPLOYMENT.
 EXTENSIBILITY – THE SAME ARCHITECTURE CAN BE ADAPTED FOR OTHER IMAGE CLASSIFICATION TASKS SUCH AS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION OR DISEASE DETECTION IN PLANTS.

 THIS PROJECT IS A COMPLETE EXAMPLE OF HOW TO TRAIN, EVALUATE, SAVE, AND DEPLOY A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION. IT PROVIDES A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPERS TO UNDERSTAND THE END-TO-END WORKFLOW OF DEEP LEARNING AND WEB DEPLOYMENT.
